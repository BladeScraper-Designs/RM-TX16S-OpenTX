# RM TX16S OpenTX
This repository contains the SD Card contents from my Horus X10S with OpenTX.  It can be used as a reference or base for setting up your own models.  It also contains the .otx file for Companion with my models and settings.  SD Card folder "BRAIN2" contains the script necessary for Brain2 + OpenTX Integration.  Everything here in the readme assumes you already have OpenTX 2.3.10 (as of 10/14/2020) installed on your radio.  Older versions of OpenTX might not work with my models.

# Info About My Radio
-I have swapped the 2 position momentary and 2 position switch on the back of the TX16S.  Momentary is now on the left, regular is now on the right.

-Volume is controlled by the left-most knob on the front of the radio.

# How to use my models as examples for your radio (for learning or experimenting, etc)
There's a write-up on my X10S GitHub on how to do this.  View the ReadMe here:
