# RM-TX16S-OpenTX
This repository contains the SD card contents and OTX file from my RadioMaster TX16S.  You can use any of the models, model images, etc for your own learning and for your helis.  You are expected to take precautions in ensuring the correct operation of my example models on your own radio and models.
